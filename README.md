# Onboarding Tour Implementation Task

You are tasked to replicate the onboarding tour in [Uniboard](https://unimad.ai/uniboard) page of [unimad.ai](https://unimad.ai) website using React Joyride.

## Getting Started

Start off by cloning this repo.

### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force

```

### Development Server

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the webpage by modifying `pages/uniboard.js` using VS Code. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Task Instructions

### Familiarize Yourself with the UI

1. **Log in** to the actual unimad.ai site and complete the sign-up process.
2. **Navigate** to the `/uniboard` page to experience the existing onboarding tour.
3. **Take notes** on the sequence of steps, messages, and interactions within the tour. These will guide your implementation.

### Implement the Onboarding Tour

1. **Replicate the tour** using React Joyride by observing the onboarding process on the unimad.ai `/uniboard` page.
2. **Integrate React Joyride components** into the provided UI. Ensure that the flow, steps, and styling are consistent with the original tour.
3. **Test the implementation** thoroughly to ensure it runs smoothly and matches the intended user experience.
